# Rube Goldberg VR *by Memo Khoury*

Hello and welcome to my Rube Goldberg VR video game! Your objective is to collect the stars and hit the goal with your ball without touching the floor! Each level contains a different set of Rube Goldberg Objects keep your ball from touching the floor and also solve your challenges efficiently.

This game is made with SteamVR and the binded buttons only work with the Rift. It took me 3 weeks to complete this project! The thing that I liked and was challenged by was the new SteamVR plugin. Although it was completely new for me and I had to do a lot of readings on it, I was mesmerized by how intuitive it was! I guess you can say that I like a challenge.

1. Clone this project
